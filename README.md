My Part II Project for the Computer Science Tripos at the University of Cambridge

Libraries:
 - CoreNLP for processing the user's input
    - Initialisation is slow, but subsequent annotations are fast
 - tuProlog for knowledge base

Plug-ins:
 - ANTLR for compiling stroy files writen within a .txt file into a useable game state
